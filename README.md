# What's in it:
- 2 webscrapers in .ipynb, one for pap.fr and one for seloger.fr
- databases of scraped apartments listings in .csv as for 21/10/20 (final base has ~2700 listings for Paris)
- final analysis .ipynb with plotly graphs and matplotlib dashboards
- a final analysis HTML file with all graphs nicely clickable 

# Conclusions:
- by renting from an individual (and not agency) in Paris, you will overpay on average 14% of the price for on average 4 m2 less
- some individual listings are breaking the law of encadrement des loyers Ã  Paris with square meter price higher than it shoul
